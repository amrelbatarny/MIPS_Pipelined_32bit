## Instruction Handling:

This pipelined MIPS processor supports a variety of instruction formats to provide a comprehensive instruction set:

* **R-Format (Arithmetic):** These instructions perform arithmetic operations on register values, such as add, subtract, and shift operations.
* **Immediate Instructions:**
    * `addi`: Adds a constant value to a register.
* **Load/Store Instructions:**
    * `lw`: Loads data from memory into a register.
    * `sw`: Stores data from a register to memory.
* **Branch Instructions:**
    * `beq`: Branches to a target address if the contents of two registers are equal.
    * `bne`: Branches to a target address if the contents of two registers are not equal.

## Hazard Handling and Exception Support:

This pipelined MIPS processor implements techniques to ensure smooth instruction execution:

* **Forwarding Unit:** This unit identifies data hazards and bypasses the pipeline stages to forward results directly to subsequent stages. This reduces stalls caused by data dependencies.
* **Hazard Detection Unit:** This unit proactively detects control hazards, such as branch instructions. Stalls are strategically inserted to ensure the correct instruction is fetched when a branch is taken.
* **Exception Support:** The processor can handle exceptions like overflow (arithmetic operations exceeding register size) and invalid instructions. These exceptions ensure program integrity and allow for proper error handling routines.

## Simulation Results

###  Sum of the array elements (0x13 + 0x95 + 0x18 + 0x3 + 0x63 + 0x47 = 0x16D) is stored in array[6]:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- ModelSim/QuestaSim for simulation
- Quartus Prime for synthesis, place-and-route, and timing analysis

### Running Simulations

1. Clone the repository by typing the following command in your terminal
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amrelbatarny/MIPS_Pipelined_32bit
```
2. Open ModelSim/QuestaSim

3. From the `File` menu, click on `Change directory` and navigate to the `Verification` directory

4. From the `Transcript` window run the following TCL command to run the script file
```tcl
do run_MIPS.do
```
